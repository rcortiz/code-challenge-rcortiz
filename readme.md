# 24-Hour Code Challenge: Static Landing Page

This repository contains my implementation responsive web shop homepage, completed within a 24-hour window. The project demonstrates modern front-end practices, structured SCSS, and the use of the [**Foundation framework**](https://get.foundation/develop/getting-started.html).

Please open all issues with this template on the main [**Foundation for Sites**](https://github.com/foundation/foundation-sites/issues) repo. This repository used the official ZURB Template of [**Foundation for Sites**](https://get.foundation/sites/docs/).

## Technical Stack
